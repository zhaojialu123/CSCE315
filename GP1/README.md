Compile: g++ -std=c++14 *cpp -w <br />

Run:  ./a.out <br />

Commits are a rough indicator of who did what. We all helped each other write code on their own computers. <br />
We met with each other several times a week. GitHub commits became an afterthought.<br />

Note: The makefile is for creating the .so file. "make lib" is the command.
