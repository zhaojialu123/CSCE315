1. command to compile the program: make
   command to run the program: ./run
2. If you want to type input from command line, please type standard correct input after you see:
   Please, enter your command(following standard input):
Note: I assume all the inputs are correct which are allowed by Dr. Ahmed in Piazza.
3. When you want to stop running this program, type Q after you see:
   Please, enter your command(following standard input):
4. If you want to test my program by using input.txt(provided by TA), Please run the program as 
     ./run < input.txt
Note: After you use this way, you will see some blanks after “Please, enter your command(following standard input):”(the prompt words), that is not an error, because you didn’t type by yourself, those blanks are supposed to be commands line which are already provided by input.txt.

Thank you for reading and reviewing my program! :)
